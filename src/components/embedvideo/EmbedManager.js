//slice or split the links to get just that last bit
//give my video div an id and link set to id can let me jump
//put something in state to help me know what vid, then in part at bottom retrieve that state...

//I will need a split function
//a clickHandler function
//a component that manages the results

//this will be child of MainPage.js, possibly grandchild of DisplayPlan.js, take props

export const EmbedManager = () => {
    //get YouTube links from state on MainPage/DisplayPlan?
    //if (plan.link.includes("youtube") )
    //let embedIdArr =  plan.link.split("?v=")
    //that will give me [first half of youtube addy, the thing I want for src embedID in YoutubeEmbed.js]
